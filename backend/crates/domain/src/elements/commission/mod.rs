//! The [`Commission`] — the platform's most basic unit of work and the aggregator
//! of the work done under it (DESIGN/Commission).
//!
//! This is the **birth** shape (ZMVP-65): only the fixed metadata that always
//! exists — a UUIDv7 [`CommissionId`], a `Title`, the owning [`UserId`], a single
//! [`LifecycleStep`], a nullable deadline, and a creation stamp. A commission is
//! created by any authenticated User with **no Account required** (a user-scoped
//! write; ZMVP-47, DD 26247170). Everything else the glossary describes — the
//! content tree of Surfaces/Components, Seats/Slots, participants beyond the
//! creator, account [`positioning`] (placement + view grants, ZMVP-70), and
//! lifecycle/status transitions — materializes in later tickets, not here. (There
//! is no "managing-account association": Ownership Separation DD `29130754` deleted
//! that concept — accounts own positioning, never the commission.)
//!
//! A commission is **isolated from accounts**: it survives account deletion and its
//! participants are always Users, never accounts. Visibility is carried as a flat
//! [`Visibility`] field defaulting to `Private` (the closed-door policy) — the three
//! values are the aliases the per-surface Surfaces DD (`28246028`) keeps for the
//! root surface's mode ([`Visibility::as_root_mode`]): since ZMVP-71 every
//! commission's root surface is born from this field, and ZMVP-74 makes the root
//! mode the authoritative direction (reconciling this flat column).
//!
//! The [`fact`] submodule carries the [`Fact`] contract (ZMVP-67) — what it means
//! for a type to be commission-anchored evidence that blocks hard deletion. The
//! [`changelog`] submodule carries the commission's append-only memory (ZMVP-87):
//! the frozen [`ChangelogEntryKind`] taxonomy, the entry shapes, and the
//! [`ChannelPointer`] "where we talk" value. The [`positioning`] submodule carries
//! the two account-facing rails (ZMVP-70): [`Placement`] (account-side, where the
//! commission sits) and the [`GrantLevel`] key-to-see (commission-side) — neither
//! confers in-commission authority (Ownership Separation DD `29130754`). The
//! [`node`] submodule carries the content **tree** (ZMVP-71): every commission is
//! born with a root surface, the owner grows surfaces under it, and the raw
//! loaded tree deliberately never serializes (projection is ZMVP-75).
